# Introduction and Setup

This is part of a set of pages on introduction to computer science. https://github.com/cmcntsh/IntroCompSci2021_topics

This course will introduce you to computer science concepts and skills (programming) that you will use in other courses in this program and informatics work in general. We're going to focus on the Python programming language and web development languages which include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These languages were chosen to give you exposure to resources commonly used in analytics and data science and application development. The first half of the semester we'll focus on Python using Jupyter Notebooks and .py script files and the last half of the semester we'll focus on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We'll focus mostly on completing multiple small programming projects and tutorials to give you experience with these programming environments. Lecture videos and readings are mostly intended to give you introduction to concepts and foundational background before you work on your assignments. You can give them a quick watch before starting the assignments. Additional videos and material which may be helpful or interesting is included in the optional material section. This course is patterned after programming boot camp style courses with a focus on learning to program and completing projects.

This week we're going to set up the tools we need to jump in and get started with some programming.

* Python - Mac users may notice Python already works from their command line. The Mac operating system includes Python.
* Anaconda - Anaconda is a collection of resources useful for learning Python and scientific computing. Windows users will need to install Anaconda before being able to try any Python.
* Conda - Conda is an environment and package manager for Python which comes with Anaconda. Mac users will also need to install Anaconda before they can use the Conda environment and package manager.
* Command line interface or CLI - Windows and Mac OS both allow you to open a command line interface. We will be using it for executing some commands.
* Git and GitHub - Git is used for version control which is useful for managing program files. GitHub is an online repository which works with Git on your machine and allows you to store files online. Many (if not most) of the assignments for this course will be accessed and submitted using GitHub. GitHub is great for putting stuff on the internet for free. We will be using public repositories for this class which means anyone online can read them. DON'T PUT ANY SENSITIVE MATERIAL ON PUBLIC REPOSITORIES! Our class assignments are not sensitive or proprietary so they're fine. GitHub does have private repositories which you can explore on your own if you want to.
* .py files - .py is the file extension used for most Python scripts. We will learn how to create and run them.
* Jupyter Notebooks - Jupyter Notebooks are a way to execute chunks of Python code and see the code with the output. Jupyter Notebooks come with Anaconda.
* VSCode - VSCode is a text editor (or lightweight IDE) we will be using with both Python and web development languages.

## Assigned Instructional Material

* Introduction to Python with Anaconda for Beginners (56 min): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mAmZIRfJBs&list=PLG9A6ovzPqX6d9uWzx0UYN9pm0zzl5ofA&index=9&t=868s
  * He uses Spyder in this introduction. We won't use it in this course, but it's not bad to see an example. We won't be doing any work from this video but it's a nice introduction. You can watch it quickly and slow down if you find areas that seem interesting.
* What can you do with Python? (12 min): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLZuut1fYzQ&list=PLG9A6ovzPqX6d9uWzx0UYN9pm0zzl5ofA&index=3
  * We won't be doing everything he talks about in this video this semester, but it's a nice review of some of the things Python is used for and areas you can explore should you choose.
